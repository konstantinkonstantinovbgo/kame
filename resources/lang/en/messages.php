    'introduction'                        => 'KAME engineering has been an engineering company for mechanical engineering since 2011. Many years of experience of the owner and entrepreneur eng. Plamen Kamenarov, and our employees and are the prerequisite for our business activities. 

Engineers make a world of difference. They take on the toughest challenges of the day and innovate solutions that make people’s lives better—today and tomorrow.
Engineers are collaborative and creative…they are problem-solvers. Every challenge has a solution—in the engineer’s world, every challenge has myriad solutions… Engineers work in teams to develop elegant solutions, designing and building practical devices and systems that make daily life safer and more fulfilling…
Engineers help shape the future. Whether it’s developing new robot systems, managing cost effective more efficiently or integrating new technologies, engineers make it happen …
KAME is committed to inspiring, solve new projects and tasks, make comfortable our Clients to take on this important next step to Industrial Revolution 4.0. 

Our mission is to help companies solve their complicated production problems. Every challenge has a solution, in the engineer’s world, every challenge has infinite solutions. We help shape the future by developing new systems that are cost effective and integrate efficiently with other new technologies. We are the path, we are industry 4.0. 

Our knowledge in the areas of maintenance, modernization and process optimization of industrial plants guarantees our customers that the machines and systems planned by us have not only functionality but also a high degree of availability and ease of maintenance. 

In addition to design, construction and calculations, we are also active in the areas of project planning, project management and consulting. 

Calculations, FEM analyzes, event analyzes and dynamic simulations are possible with our modern CAD + calculation programs. ',
